                        These Terms and Conditions also apply to all future transactions, even if they are not expressly
                        agreed again and
                        even if the Buyer expressly refers to its own delivery and payment terms or contradicts those of the

                        previously deviating Terms and Conditions existed. The Buyer's Terms and Conditions are hereby

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>1. Offers from the Seller are subject to change and non-binding. An order is a binding offer and can
                        be accepted, at
                        the Seller's discretion, with a delivery or an order confirmation within 8 days. Additions or
                        ancillary agreements must
                        be made in writing. Deviations from this written form requirement can also only be made in writing.
                    </p>

                    <p>2. Seller's employees are not authorized to enter into any oral or written collateral agreements or
                        representations.</p>
                    <p>3. Drawings, illustrations, Measurement, weights, or other performance data are non-binding or taken
                        from
                        manufacturer specifications.</p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>1. Any quoted or confirmed prices are valid for 8 days, unless unforeseeable changes occur, e.g., in
                        sales tax, import
                        and export duties, exchange rates, insurance and/or war insurance premiums, or price increases by
                        suppliers. These
                        changes are then at the buyer's expense. All prices are net and are charged plus statutory VAT.</p>
                    <p>2. The prices at the time of the order apply. The validity period of limited-time offers can be found
                        where they
                        are displayed in the shop. Despite careful stock management, it may happen that a promotional item
                        is sold out
                        or out of stock sooner than expected. We therefore do not offer a delivery guarantee. "While stocks
                        last."</p>
                    <p>3. These prices for deliveries and services are ex-works in Muehlheim am Main and are not subject to
                        discount unless
                        otherwise stated.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-title">§4 Deliveries and Services</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>1. Delivery dates are non-binding, but the seller will endeavor to meet them unless prevented from
                        doing so by
                        exceptional circumstances such as government orders, strikes, lockouts, foreign exchange
                        restrictions, war, fire,
                        blockades, energy shortages, etc. Confirmed delivery dates from suppliers will also be passed on
                        without obligation.
                        The seller is entitled to postpone these dates for the duration of the disruption and a reasonable
                        period of time, or
                        to withdraw from the contract in whole or in part.</p>
                    <p>2. If the disruption lasts longer than 3 months, the seller is entitled to withdraw from the
                        unfulfilled part of the
                        contract in whole or in part. If the delivery time is extended or the seller is released from its
                        obligation, the buyer
                        cannot claim any damages.</p>
                    <p>3. If the seller withdraws from the contract due to the unavailability of the goods/services, the
                        seller will inform the
                        buyer immediately and refund the buyer's consideration.</p>
                    <p>4. If the seller is unable to meet the binding delivery dates due to its own fault, the buyer is
                        entitled to 0.5% for each
                        completed week of delay, but not more than 5% of the total invoice value.</p>
                    <p>5. If the buyer is unable to accept the goods or services immediately, for whatever reason, all
                        resulting costs shall be
                        borne by the buyer.</p>
                    <p>6. The seller is entitled to make partial deliveries and services at any time.</p>
                    <p>7. Orders to the seller for further processing and finishing of the goods shall be entirely at the
                        buyer's risk, especially
                        if third parties are involved in this transaction.</p>

                        impossible, the risk passes to the buyer upon notification of readiness for shipment. The place of

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>1. The buyer must immediately inspect the goods for defects, completeness, and accuracy, especially
                        if the goods
                        are to be resold, printed, embroidered, or otherwise processed. The buyer is obligated to notify the
                        seller of any
                        defects in writing within 8 days of receipt of the goods. The notification must precisely state the
                        nature and extent
                        of the non-conformity. Hidden defects must be reported in writing immediately upon discovery, but no
                        later than 6
                        months after receipt of the goods.</p>
                    <p>2. In the event of defects, the seller is entitled, at its discretion, to repair them or provide
                        replacements. If this is not
                        possible, it may also withdraw from the contract in whole or in part.</p>
                    <p>3. If this repair also fails, the buyer may, at its discretion, demand a reduction in the price or
                        cancellation of the
                        contract with regard to the defective goods, but not with regard to the properly delivered goods.
                    </p>
                    <p>4. Warranties under sections 1-3 apply only to the buyer, are non-transferable, and expire after 6
                        months.</p>
                    <p>5. The seller expressly cannot be held liable for faulty workmanship on the goods by third parties
                        (e.g., printing,
                        embroidery). Such defects must be reported to the seller in writing immediately upon receipt of the
                        goods. In the
                        case of legitimate defects resulting from further processing, the seller may pass these on to the
                        third party and will
                        inform the buyer of this and provide replacement cables if necessary. The buyer is aware of this and
                        hereby expressly
                        confirms this.</p>
                    <p>6. Warranty claims are fully regulated by the above-mentioned clauses and exclude any claims of any
                        kind by the
                        buyer, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>1. The seller retains title to the goods until all payments (including any balances from current
                        accounts) arising from
                        the business relationship have been received.</p>
                    <p>2. The buyer is entitled to process and sell the goods in the course of business as long as he is not
                        in default of
                        payment. This also applies to any other invoices arising from the business relationship with the
                        seller. However,
                        the buyer is obligated to inspect these goods for defects in accordance with §6, 1).
                        After processing the goods, resale or reduction of the purchase price is excluded. Pledges or
                        transfers of ownership
                        by way of security are not permitted.</p>
                    <p>3. The buyer hereby assigns to the seller any claims arising from the resale or other legal grounds
                        in the amount of
                        the invoice value of our claim.</p>
                    <p>4. The claim may be collected by the buyer himself or by the seller, at the seller's discretion. The
                        buyer is obligated
                        to inform third parties of the security interest in the goods until full payment of the goods.</p>

                    <p>1. Unless otherwise agreed, all invoices are payable net within 10 days of invoicing.</p>
                    <p>2. The seller is entitled, despite any contrary provisions of the buyer, to initially offset payments
                        against the buyer's
                        older debts. The buyer will be informed of this immediately. Payments will initially be offset
                        against other costs
                        and interest.</p>
                    <p>3. Payment is only deemed to have been made when the seller has access to the funds (bills of
                        exchange after their
                        due date). If the buyer is in default, the usual bank interest rate for current account overdrafts
                        may be charged.</p>
                    <p>4. The buyer is only entitled to offset undisputed or legally established claims; this also applies
                        to notices of
                        defects.</p>
                    <p>5. If the buyer becomes aware of circumstances that call into question the buyer's creditworthiness,
                        in particular if
                        a payment promise is not kept or the buyer defaults, the seller is entitled to demand payment of the
                        entire
                        remaining debt, even if it would not yet be due according to the payment terms. In this case, the
                        seller is entitled
                        to demand security.</p>

                        that
                        compensation is sought for indirect or consequential damages. Claims for damages due to at least
